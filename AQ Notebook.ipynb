    "Let's analyze the time complexity of the provided algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Reading:**\n",
    "   - Reading the number of athletes (`n`), athletes to be chosen (`m`), and the number of sports skills per athlete (`s`) takes constant time, O(1).\n",

    "2. **Sports Input:**\n",
    "   - Reading the list of sports skills (`sports`) takes O(s) time, where s is the number of sports skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Athlete Information Input:**\n",
    "   - Reading information about each athlete (athlete ID, sports skills, and proficiency) involves a nested loop. The outer loop runs 'n' times (number of athletes), and the inner loop runs 's' times (number of sports skills per athlete). So, the time complexity of this part is O(n ⋅ s).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sport Selection Loop:**\n",
    "   - The outer loop runs 's' times (number of sports). In each iteration, there is an inner loop over all athletes ('n' athletes) to find the athlete with the highest proficiency in the current sport. In the worst case, each athlete is considered for each sport, resulting in a time complexity of O(s ⋅ n).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overall Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Combining the complexities of the above steps, the overall time complexity is O(1) + O(s) + O(n ⋅ s) + O(s ⋅ n), which simplifies to O(n ⋅ s).\n",
