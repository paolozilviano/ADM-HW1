# ADM-HW1

This GitHub repository was created to submit **Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining's HomeWork_1**.

Here you can find as requested by the assignment the PDF file created from the submission page of HackerRank named *submissions_merged.pdf* and the Python code of my solutions, a .py file named *scripts.py*

Some exercise are missing but compared to the large amount of tasks in this homework it's a small percentage.

For some exercises I helped myself with the Hackerrank discussions, but I  never copied and paste the code.
